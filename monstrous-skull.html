  <h1>Monstrous Skull (Failed Mermaids)</h1>

  <p>In “failed mermaids,” an abnormal head structure serves as an <strong>“overt marker.”</strong> It is used as a visible sign of incomplete evolution. During development, Oceanin — which should guide balanced skull growth and sensory organ positioning — is abnormally expressed. This causes neural crest cells in the head region to cluster incorrectly, triggering misplaced bone formation signals. Consequently, ectopic ossification occurs in the parietal and occipital bones, forming bony protrusions resembling fish fins.</p>

  <h2>Structural Composition</h2>
  <p>A mix of bone and crystal, containing trace amounts of Oceanin crystal nuclei but lacking further crystallization guidance, resulting in irregular shapes.</p>

  <h2>Further Info: Tissue Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The bone spur surface is covered by a thin epidermal layer but lacks blood vessels and sensory nerves, making it prone to infection yet painless.</li>
    <li>The structure is highly individualized, and left-right asymmetry is common.</li>
    <li>These protrusions do not serve any genuine sensory function; they are merely developmental remnants.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Functional Impact & Costs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Facial Disproportion</strong>: Abnormal frontal and parietal bone growth leads to reduced aesthetics, often with asymmetrical features.</li>
    <li><strong>Thermoregulatory Disorders</strong>: Bone spurs alter the head’s heat exchange surface area, causing overheating or overcooling.</li>
    <li><strong>Restricted Head Movement</strong>: Protrusions at the back of the neck press against muscle origin points, limiting neck mobility.</li>
    <li><strong>Psychological Effects</strong>: Social rejection and aesthetic concerns may lead to feelings of inferiority or aggressive traits.</li>
  </ul>
