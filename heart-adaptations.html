  <h1>Heart Adaptations</h1>

  <p>Due to Oceanin’s presence and the need to adapt to deep-sea living, the heart differs from a typical human heart by forming a crystalline layer on its surface. This layer results from Oceanin reacting with seawater minerals and is referred to as the <strong>“Cardial Crystal Layer.”</strong></p>

  <h2>Characteristics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Thickness: approximately 2–4 mm, covering the entire surface of the heart.</li>
    <li>Tissue Morphology: Resembles a mixture of pearl and cartilage, transparent and glossy.</li>
    <li>Properties: Slightly elastic but with extremely high compressive resistance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Further Info: Crystallization Process</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Synthesis</strong>: Active Oceanin is synthesized in the bloodstream.</li>
    <li><strong>Receptor Binding</strong>: Heart epicardial cells express a specialized receptor (OCPR) that recognizes and adsorbs the Oceanin complex, initiating deposition on the surface.</li>
    <li><strong>Enzymatic Activation</strong>: The Oceanin complex activates an enzyme called <em>Cardio-Crystalase</em>, which refolds the protein chain, serving as a crystallization nucleation template. Minerals from seawater then deposit in an orderly fashion, creating an organic–inorganic composite crystal.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Specific Functions & Rationale</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>High-Pressure Resistance</strong>: Prevents myocardial deformation under deep-sea pressures.</li>
    <li><strong>Electrical Signal Regulation</strong>: Enhances synchronization of cardiac electrical potentials, preventing arrhythmias.</li>
    <li><strong>Bioluminescence Response</strong>: Refracts faint deep-sea light to stimulate special photosensitive proteins, regulating heart rate.</li>
    <li><strong>Immune Barrier</strong>: Adsorbs antimicrobial peptides, shielding the heart from deep-sea pathogens.</li>
  </ul>
