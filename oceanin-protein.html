  <h1>Oceanin Protein</h1>

  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>Oceanin protein is a fictional, extremely powerful protein that grants all mermaid traits beyond what natural evolution alone could achieve. It is synthesized in both the liver and the bone marrow.</p>

  <h2>Conceptual Positioning</h2>
  <p>Oceanin is a cross-system reactive protein, responsible not only for mineral chelation and crystallization guidance but also for regulating neural transmission, immune protection, and skin metabolism. Therefore, its synthesis mechanism must possess:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Strong metabolic capabilities (to synthesize complex domains)</li>
    <li>Immunological recognition and hematopoietic involvement (so that it can remain stable in the bloodstream)</li>
    <li>Wide yet precisely controlled tissue distribution (different concentrations in different parts of the body)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Synthesis Environment</h2>
  <p>Oceanin requires a high-pressure, mineral-rich environment (matching the ocean), which induces Oceanin to self-assemble structurally.</p>

  <h2>Further Info: Why Both Liver and Bone Marrow?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Liver</strong>: The largest metabolic factory in the body, responsible for protein synthesis, detoxification, and mineral metabolism regulation.</li>
    <li><strong>Bone Marrow</strong>: The core of the immune and hematopoietic systems, responsible for secreting cytokines, acute-phase proteins, complement factors, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This combination aligns well with producing a complex, multifunctional protein like Oceanin.</p>

  <h2>Composition</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>From the Liver</strong>: The primary form — <em>Oceanin-P (Primary Form)</em>, a glycoprotein with multiple chelating groups.</li>
    <li><strong>From the Bone Marrow</strong>: The activation fragment — <em>Oceanin-A (Active Form)</em>, a short peptide that initiates crystallization processes.</li>
  </ul>
